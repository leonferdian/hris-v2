# HRIS Absensi – Change History

## 2025-10-29
- Added lock-date UI parity between HRIS and KADEPO reports; locked days are rendered without links.
- Normalized HRIS attendance counts to mirror KADEPO (removed ≥6 hour filter).
- Fixed action dropdown menus on report detail pages to auto-dropup / reposition; added global handling for scroll areas.
- Authored `pipeline.md` update summarizing recent progress and roadmap adjustments.
- Created `infrastructure.md` outlining React/Next.js migration, Docker architecture, JWT bridge with legacy MD5, and AI assistant integration.
